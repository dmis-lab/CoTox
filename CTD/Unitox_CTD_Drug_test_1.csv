RAMIPRIL,"The drug label for ALTACE (ramipril) discusses several aspects related to cardiotoxicity risks and cardiotoxic reactions. Here is a summary of the relevant parts:

1. **Indications and Usage (1.1, 1.2, 1.3)**
   - ALTACE is indicated for the treatment of hypertension to lower blood pressure, which reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. This indicates that the drug is used to mitigate cardiovascular risks rather than cause them.

2. **Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.5, 5.7)**
   - **Angioedema (5.1)**: Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, and larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including ALTACE. This reaction can be fatal if it involves the larynx. This indicates that ALTACE can cause angioedema, which is a serious adverse reaction that can affect the cardiovascular system.
   - **Hypotension (5.5)**: ALTACE can cause symptomatic hypotension, especially in patients who are volume- and/or salt-depleted. This indicates that ALTACE can cause hypotension, which is a cardiovascular effect.
   - **Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (5.7)**: Dual blockade with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function, including acute renal failure. This suggests that combining ALTACE with other RAS inhibitors can increase cardiovascular risks.

3. **Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)**
   - **Clinical Trials Experience (6.1)**: The most frequent clinical side effects reported by patients receiving ALTACE in placebo-controlled trials included headache, dizziness, and fatigue. Hypotension was reported in 0.5% of patients in U.S. trials. This indicates that ALTACE can cause hypotension, a cardiovascular effect.

     - **Summary**: The drug itself has not been studied in patients with liver impairment, so its effects on such patients are unknown.
   - ""Because ropinirole is extensively metabolized by the liver, these patients may have higher plasma levels and lower clearance of ropinirole than patients with normal hepatic function.""
     - **Summary**: The drug itself is metabolized by the liver, suggesting that patients with liver impairment might experience higher drug levels and reduced clearance, potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects.

2. **Section 12.3 Pharmacokinetics**:
   - ""The pharmacokinetics of ropinirole have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Because ropinirole is extensively metabolized by the liver, these patients may have higher plasma levels and lower clearance of ropinirole than patients with normal hepatic function.""
     - **Summary**: The drug itself has not been studied in patients with liver impairment, and due to its extensive liver metabolism, such patients might have higher drug levels and reduced clearance, potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects.

In summary, while the drug label does not directly associate Ropinirole with liver toxicity or injury, it does highlight that the drug is extensively metabolized by the liver. This implies that patients with liver impairment could have altered drug metabolism, leading to higher plasma levels and reduced clearance, which could potentially increase the risk of adverse effects.

DABRAFENIB,"### Summary of Cardiotoxicity Risks and Cardiotoxic Reactions for TAFINLAR (Dabrafenib)

#### Warnings and Precautions
1. **Cardiomyopathy**: 
   - **TAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Adult)**: In the pooled safety population, cardiomyopathy, defined as a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 10% from baseline and below the institutional lower limit of normal (LLN), occurred in 6% of patients. This indicates that the combination of TAFINLAR and trametinib is associated with cardiomyopathy.
   - **TAFINLAR Administered with Trametinib (Pediatric)**: In the pooled safety population, cardiomyopathy, defined as a decrease in LVEF ≥ 10% from baseline and below the institutional LLN, occurred in 9% of patients. This indicates that the combination of TAFINLAR and trametinib is associated with cardiomyopathy in pediatric patients.
   - **Monitoring and Management**: Assess LVEF by echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan before initiation of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib, one month after initiation, and then at 2- to 3-month intervals while on treatment. Withhold TAFINLAR for symptomatic cardiomyopathy or asymptomatic LV dysfunction of > 20% from baseline that is below institutional LLN. Resume TAFINLAR at the same dose level upon recovery of cardiac function to at least the institutional LLN for LVEF and absolute decrease ≤ 10% compared to baseline. This indicates that TAFINLAR, when used with trametinib, requires careful monitoring for cardiotoxicity.

#### Adverse Reactions
1. **TAFINLAR with Trametinib (Adult)**: In the pooled safety population, cardiomyopathy resulted in dose interruption or discontinuation of TAFINLAR in 3% and < 1% of patients, respectively. This indicates that the combination of TAFINLAR and trametinib can lead to cardiomyopathy severe enough to require dose adjustments or discontinuation.
2. **TAFINLAR with Trametinib (Pediatric)**: In the pooled safety population, cardiomyopathy resulted in dose interruption or discontinuation of TAFINLAR in pediatric patients. This indicates that the combination of TAFINLAR and trametinib can lead to cardiomyopathy in pediatric patients as well.

#### Clinical Trials Experience
1. **COMBI-d Study**: Adverse reactions leading to dose interruptions of TAFINLAR occurred in 56% of patients who received TAFINLAR plus trametinib; the most frequent were pyrexia (35%), chills (11%), vomiting (7%), nausea (5%), and decreased ejection fraction (5%). This indicates that the combination of TAFINLAR and trametinib can lead to decreased ejection fraction, a sign of cardiotoxicity.
2. **COMBI-AD Study**: Other clinically important adverse reactions for TAFINLAR in the COMBI-AD study observed in less than 20% of patients who received TAFINLAR administered with trametinib were: decreased ejection fraction (5%). This indicates that the combination of TAFINLAR and trametinib can lead to decreased ejection fraction.
3. **Study BRF117019**: Clinically relevant adverse reactions for TAFINLAR in Study BRF117019 observed in less than 20% of patients who received TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib were: decreased ejection fraction (8%). This indicates that the combination of TAFINLAR and trametinib can lead to decreased ejection fraction.
4. **Study X2101**: Serious adverse reactions in > 5% of patients included decreased ejection fraction (6%). Permanent treatment discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 21% of patients, including decreased ejection fraction (4.2%). This indicates that the combination of TAFINLAR and trametinib can lead to decreased ejection fraction in pediatric patients.
5. **Study G2201**: Serious adverse reactions in > 3% of patients included decreased ejection fraction (4%). This indicates that the combination of TAFINLAR and trametinib can lead to decreased ejection fraction in pediatric patients.

#### Postmarketing Experience
1. **Cardiac**: Atrioventricular block complete has been identified during post-approval use of TAFINLAR in combination with trametinib. This indicates that the combination of TAFINLAR and trametinib can lead to severe cardiac conduction issues.

24. **Adverse Reactions (6.1 Clinical Trials",Most,Yes,1.0,1,"The drug label for XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution does not explicitly mention kidney toxicity, kidney injury, renal toxicity, or nephrotoxicity risks directly associated with the drug itself. However, there are several sections that discuss renal impairment and its implications for drug administration and dosage adjustments. Here is a summary of those parts:

1. **Dosage and Administration (Section 2.2, 2.3, 2.4)**
   - **Moderate and Severe Renal Impairment**: The label states that patients with moderate or severe renal impairment had greater tofacitinib blood concentrations than those with normal renal function. Therefore, dosage adjustment is recommended for these patients. This indicates that while the drug itself is not directly associated with causing renal toxicity, its pharmacokinetics are affected by existing renal impairment, necessitating dosage adjustments.

2. **Use in Specific Populations (Section 8.7)**
   - **Renal Impairment**: The label reiterates that patients with moderate or severe renal impairment had higher blood concentrations of tofacitinib, and thus, dosage adjustments are recommended. This again highlights the need for caution in patients with pre-existing renal conditions but does not indicate that the drug causes renal toxicity.

3. **Pharmacokinetics (Section 12.3)**
   - **Specific Populations**: The label mentions that in subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis, mean AUC (area under the curve) was approximately 40% higher compared with historical healthy subject data. This suggests that renal function significantly affects the drug's pharmacokinetics, but it does not imply that the drug causes renal toxicity.

4. **Overdosage (Section 10)**
   - **Hemodialysis**: The label notes that in a study of subjects with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis, plasma tofacitinib concentrations declined more rapidly during hemodialysis. This indicates that hemodialysis can help manage overdose but does not suggest that the drug itself causes renal toxicity.

In summary, the drug label for XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR/XELJANZ Oral Solution does not directly associate the drug with causing kidney toxicity, kidney injury, renal toxicity, or nephrotoxicity. Instead, it emphasizes the need for dosage adjustments in patients with pre-existing renal impairment due to altered pharmacokinetics in these populations.",Less,No,,0,CC1CCN(C(=O)CC#N)CC1N(C)c1ncnc2[nH]ccc12,CC1CCN(C(=O)CC#N)CC1N(C)c1ncnc2[nH]ccc12

These reactions are probably due to allergic and inflammatory responses to the death of microfilariae. This is not directly related to pulmonary toxicity but indicates a potential for systemic inflammatory responses.

2. **Precautions**:
   - The label states that rarely, patients with onchocerciasis who are also heavily infected with *Loa loa* may develop a serious or even fatal encephalopathy either spontaneously or following treatment with an effective microfilaricide. In these patients, adverse experiences such as dyspnea (difficulty breathing) have been reported. This suggests that dyspnea could be a reaction in patients with *Loa loa* infection, but it does not directly attribute this to ivermectin itself.

3. **Adverse Reactions**:
   - In the section discussing adverse reactions for onchocerciasis, the label lists worsening of Mazzotti reactions, which include systemic inflammatory responses. However, it does not specifically mention pulmonary reactions directly caused by ivermectin.
   - The label also mentions that in post-marketing experience, hypotension (mainly orthostatic hypotension) and worsening of bronchial asthma have been reported. This indicates that there have been reports of bronchial asthma worsening, but it does not definitively state that ivermectin caused these reactions.

4. **Overdosage**:
   - In the case of accidental intoxication with or significant exposure to veterinary formulations of ivermectin in humans, adverse effects such as dyspnea have been reported.

1. **Association with Increases in Serum Transaminases**: Fenofibrate has been associated with increases in serum transaminases (AST and ALT). This indicates that the drug itself is associated with liver toxicity risk.
2. **Pooled Analysis Data**: In a pooled analysis of 10 placebo-controlled trials, increases to more than three times the upper limit of normal for ALT occurred in 5.3% of patients taking fenofibrate versus 1.1% of patients treated with placebo. This suggests that the drug itself is associated with liver toxicity risk.
3. **Dose-Related Incidence**: The incidence of increases in transaminases observed with fenofibrate therapy appears to be dose-related. This indicates that the drug itself is associated with liver toxicity risk.
4. **Return to Normal Limits**: When transaminase determinations were followed either after discontinuation of treatment or during continued treatment, a return to normal limits was usually observed. This suggests that the liver toxicity risk associated with the drug may be reversible.
5. **Hepatitis Reports**: Hepatocellular, chronic active, and cholestatic hepatitis associated with fenofibrate therapy have been reported after exposures of weeks to several years. This indicates that the drug itself is associated with liver toxicity risk.
6. **Rare Cases of Cirrhosis**: In extremely rare cases, cirrhosis has been reported in association with chronic active hepatitis. This suggests that the drug itself is associated with severe liver toxicity risk.
7. **Monitoring Recommendations**: Baseline and regular, periodic monitoring of liver function, including ALT, should be performed for the duration of therapy with FIBRICOR, and therapy should be discontinued if enzyme levels persist above three times the normal limit. This indicates that the drug itself is associated with liver toxicity risk and requires monitoring.

#### Contraindications (Section 4)
1. **Active Liver Disease**: FIBRICOR is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease, including those with primary biliary cirrhosis and unexplained persistent liver function abnormalities. This indicates that the drug itself is associated with liver toxicity risk and should not be used in patients with existing liver conditions.

#### Adverse Reactions (Section 6.1: Clinical Trials Experience)
1. **Increases in Liver Function Tests**: Increases in liver function tests were the most frequent events causing discontinuation of fenofibrate treatment in 1.6% of patients in double-blind trials. This indicates that the drug itself is associated with liver toxicity risk.

#### Use in Specific Populations (Section 8.7: Hepatic Impairment)
1. **Lack of Evaluation in Hepatic Impairment**: The use of FIBRICOR has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment. This suggests caution due to potential liver toxicity risk associated with the drug.

1. **Contraindications:**
   - **Severe Renal Dysfunction:** FIBRICOR is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment, including those receiving dialysis. This indicates that the drug itself is associated with renal toxicity risk in these patients.

2. **Warnings and Precautions:**
   - **Serum Creatinine:** Elevations in serum creatinine have been reported in patients on fenofibrate. These elevations tend to return to baseline following discontinuation of fenofibrate. This suggests that the drug itself is associated with renal toxicity risk.
   - **Renal Monitoring:** Renal monitoring should be considered for patients with renal impairment and for patients at risk for renal insufficiency, such as the elderly and patients with diabetes. This indicates that the drug itself is associated with renal toxicity risk.
   - **Immunosuppressants:** Immunosuppressant agents such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus can produce nephrotoxicity with decreases in creatinine clearance and rises in serum creatinine. Because renal excretion is the primary elimination route of fibrate drugs, including FIBRICOR, there is a risk that an interaction will lead to deterioration of renal function. This suggests that the drug itself is associated with renal toxicity risk when used with immunosuppressants.

3. **Use in Specific Populations:**
   - **Renal Impairment:** The use of FIBRICOR should be avoided in patients who have severe renal impairment. Dose reduction is required in patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment. Monitoring renal function in patients with renal impairment is recommended. This indicates that the drug itself is associated with renal toxicity risk.
   - **Geriatric Use:** Since elderly patients have a higher incidence of renal impairment, dose selection for the elderly should be made on the basis of renal function. This suggests that the drug itself is associated with renal toxicity risk in elderly patients.

4. **Clinical Pharmacology:**
   - **Renal Impairment:** Patients with severe renal impairment showed a 2.7-fold increase in exposure for fenofibric acid and increased accumulation of fenofibric acid during chronic dosing compared to that of healthy subjects. Patients with mild-to-moderate renal impairment had similar exposure but an increase in the half-life for fenofibric acid compared to that of healthy subjects. This indicates that the drug itself is associated with renal toxicity risk.

5. **Drug Interactions:**
   - **Immunosuppressants:** Immunosuppressant agents such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus can produce nephrotoxicity. Because renal excretion is the primary elimination route of fibrate drugs, including FIBRICOR, there is a risk that an interaction will lead to deterioration of renal function. This suggests that the drug itself is associated with renal toxicity risk when used with immunosuppressants.

1. **Clinical Pharmacology:**
   - **Renal Excretion:** Approximately 85% of cefoxitin is excreted unchanged by the kidneys over a 6-hour period. This indicates that the drug is primarily eliminated through renal pathways, which could be relevant for patients with renal impairment.

2. **Warnings:**
   - **Hypersensitivity Reactions:** Serious hypersensitivity reactions may require emergency measures, but this is not directly related to renal toxicity.

3. **Precautions:**
   - **Dosage Adjustment in Renal Insufficiency:** The total daily dose should be reduced in patients with transient or persistent reduction of urinary output due to renal insufficiency. This is because high and prolonged serum antibiotic concentrations can occur in such individuals from usual doses. This indicates that the drug itself can cause issues if not properly dosed in patients with renal impairment.
   - **Prolonged Use:** Prolonged use of cefoxitin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, but this is not directly related to renal toxicity.

4. **Adverse Reactions:**
   - **Renal Function:** Elevations in serum creatinine and/or blood urea nitrogen levels have been observed. Acute renal failure has been reported rarely. The role of cefoxitin in changes in renal function tests is difficult to assess, as factors predisposing to prerenal azotemia or impaired renal function usually have been present. This suggests that while the drug has been associated with renal function changes, it is not definitively the cause.
   - **Cephalosporin Class Reactions:** Several cephalosporins, including cefoxitin, have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced. This indicates that cefoxitin itself can cause adverse reactions, including seizures, in patients with renal impairment if not properly dosed.

5. **Drug Interactions:**
   - **Nephrotoxicity with Aminoglycosides:** Increased nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of cephalosporins and aminoglycoside antibiotics. This suggests that cefoxitin, when used with aminoglycosides, can increase the risk of nephrotoxicity.

6. **Geriatric Use:**
   - **Renal Function Monitoring:** Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. This indicates that the drug itself requires careful dosing and monitoring in elderly patients to avoid renal toxicity.

7. **Dosage and Administration:**
   - **Renal Insufficiency Dosage Adjustments:** In adults with renal insufficiency, an initial loading dose of 1 gram to 2 grams may be given, followed by maintenance dosage adjustments based on creatinine clearance. This indicates that the drug itself requires dosage adjustments to prevent renal toxicity in patients with renal insufficiency.

### Conclusion
Cefoxitin for Injection, USP has several considerations related to renal toxicity and nephrotoxicity. The drug itself can cause or exacerbate renal issues, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or when used in conjunction with other nephrotoxic drugs like aminoglycosides. Proper dosing and monitoring are crucial to mitigate these risks.",Less,Yes,,1,COC1(NC(=O)Cc2cccs2)C(=O)N2C(C(=O)O)=C(COC(N)=O)CSC21,COC1(NC(=O)Cc2cccs2)C(=O)N2C(C(=O)O)=C(COC(N)=O)CSC21
MACITENTAN,"The drug label for OPSUMIT (macitentan) discusses several aspects related to cardiotoxicity risks and cardiotoxic reactions. Here is a summary of those parts:

   - **Association**: The drug itself (OPSUMIT) may cause pulmonary edema in patients with PVOD.

3. **Decreased Sperm Counts (Section 5.7)**:
   - **Summary**: OPSUMIT, like other ERAs, may have an adverse effect on spermatogenesis.
   - **Association**: The drug itself (OPSUMIT) is associated with decreased sperm counts, which is indirectly related to cardiotoxicity as it affects overall reproductive health.

4. **Adverse Reactions (Section 6.1)**:
   - **Summary**: In the placebo-controlled study of OPSUMIT in PAH, the incidence of edema was 21.9% in the OPSUMIT 10 mg group and 20.5% in the placebo group.
   - **Association**: The drug itself (OPSUMIT) is associated with a higher incidence of edema compared to placebo.

5. **Postmarketing Experience (Section 6.2)**:
   - **Summary**: Cases of edema and fluid retention occurring within weeks of starting OPSUMIT, some requiring intervention with a diuretic or hospitalization for decompensated heart failure, have been reported.
   - **Association**: The drug itself (OPSUMIT) is associated with postmarketing reports of edema and fluid retention, sometimes leading to heart failure.

6. **Clinical Studies (Section 14.1)**:
   - **Summary**: In a small study of OPSUMIT in patients with pulmonary hypertension because of left ventricular dysfunction, more patients in the OPSUMIT group developed significant fluid retention and had more hospitalizations because of worsening heart failure compared to those randomized to placebo.
   - **Association**: The drug itself (OPSUMIT) is associated with significant fluid retention and increased hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.

7. **Animal Toxicology (Section 13.2)**:
   - **Summary**: In dogs, macitentan decreased blood pressure at exposures similar to the therapeutic human exposure. Intimal thickening of coronary arteries was observed at 17-fold the human exposure after 4 to 39 weeks of treatment.

#### 1. **Dosage and Administration (Section 2.4)**
- **Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment of VEKLURY is recommended in patients with any degree of renal impairment, including those on dialysis. This indicates that the drug itself does not necessitate dosage changes due to renal toxicity risks.

#### 2. **Warnings and Precautions (Section 5.2)**
- **Increased Risk of Transaminase Elevations:** This section does not directly discuss renal toxicity but focuses on liver enzyme elevations. It does not attribute renal toxicity to the drug itself.

#### 3. **Adverse Reactions (Section 6.1)**
- **Clinical Trials Experience in Adults with COVID-19 and Renal Impairment:** The adverse reactions observed in patients with renal impairment were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of VEKLURY in adults. This suggests that the drug itself did not show additional renal toxicity in these patients.
- **Study GS-US-540-5912:** In this study, adverse reactions were reported in 13 (8%) subjects in the VEKLURY group and 3 (4%) subjects in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions were nausea (1%), abdominal pain (1%), and diarrhea (1%). No subjects experienced serious adverse reactions. One subject permanently discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction: lipase increased. This indicates that the drug itself was not directly associated with significant renal toxicity.

#### 4. **Use in Specific Populations (Section 8.6)**
- **Renal Impairment:** The pharmacokinetics and safety of VEKLURY in patients with COVID-19 and renal impairment, including those on dialysis, were evaluated. Exposures of GS-441524 and GS-704277, the metabolites of remdesivir, and SBECD are increased in subjects with mild to severe renal impairment, including those requiring dialysis. These changes are not considered to be clinically significant, suggesting that the drug itself does not cause significant renal toxicity.
- **Study GS-US-540-5912:** This study evaluated VEKLURY in 243 hospitalized adult subjects with confirmed COVID-19 and renal impairment. The safety results in subjects with COVID-19 and renal impairment, including those on dialysis, were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of VEKLURY in adults. This indicates that the drug itself did not show additional renal toxicity in these patients.

#### 5. **Nonclinical Toxicology (Section 13.2)**
- **Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology:** Intravenous administration (slow bolus) of remdesivir to male rhesus monkeys at dosage levels of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg/day for 7 days resulted, at all dose levels, in increased mean urea nitrogen and increased mean creatinine, renal tubular atrophy, and basophilia and casts. This indicates that the drug itself was associated with renal toxicity in animal studies.
- **Intravenous administration (slow bolus) of remdesivir to rats at dosage levels of ≥3 mg/kg/day for up to 4 weeks resulted in findings indicative of kidney injury and/or dysfunction.** This indicates that the drug itself was associated with renal toxicity in animal studies.

### Conclusion
- **Human Studies:** In clinical trials and studies involving humans, VEKLURY (remdesivir) did not show significant renal toxicity or necessitate dosage adjustments due to renal impairment. The adverse reactions in patients with renal impairment were consistent with those observed in the general population.
- **Animal Studies:** In animal studies, remdesivir was associated with renal toxicity, including increased urea nitrogen, creatinine, renal tubular atrophy, and basophilia and casts in monkeys, and kidney injury and/or dysfunction in rats.

These risks have been observed in both human and animal studies, and patients should be counseled about these potential effects.",Most,Yes,1.0,1,"### Summary of Liver Toxicity, Liver Injury, and Hepatotoxicity Risks for Letairis (Ambrisentan)

1. **Warnings and Precautions (Section 5.6)**
   - **Hematological Changes**: Decreases in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit have been observed in clinical studies with Letairis. These decreases were observed within the first few weeks of treatment with Letairis and stabilized thereafter. The mean decrease in hemoglobin from baseline to end of treatment for those patients receiving Letairis in the 12-week placebo-controlled studies was 0.8 g/dL. This section does not directly link Letairis to liver toxicity but mentions hematological changes that could be related to liver function.

2. **Adverse Reactions (Section 6.1)**
   - **Clinical Trials Experience**: During 12-week controlled clinical trials, the incidence of aminotransferase elevations >3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) were 0% on Letairis and 2.3% on placebo. This indicates that Letairis was not associated with aminotransferase elevations in the clinical trials.
   - **Combination Use with Tadalafil**: The mean exposure to Letairis + tadalafil in the AMBITION study was 78.7 weeks. The adverse reactions that occurred in >5% more patients receiving Letairis + tadalafil than receiving Letairis or tadalafil monotherapy in AMBITION are shown in Table 2. This section does not specifically mention liver toxicity.

3. **Adverse Reactions (Section 6.2)**
   - **Postmarketing Experience**: Elevations of liver aminotransferases (ALT, AST) have been reported with Letairis use; in most cases, alternative causes of the liver injury could be identified (heart failure, hepatic congestion, hepatitis, alcohol use, hepatotoxic medications). This indicates that while liver enzyme elevations have been reported, they were not directly attributed to Letairis in most cases.

4. **Use in Specific Populations (Section 8.7)**
   - **Hepatic Impairment**: Letairis is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. There is no information on the use of Letairis in patients with mild pre-existing impaired liver function; however, exposure to ambrisentan may be increased in these patients. This suggests a precautionary approach due to potential increased exposure in patients with liver impairment, but does not directly link Letairis to causing liver toxicity.

5. **Clinical Studies (Section 14.4)**
   - **Adverse Effects in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)**: A randomized controlled study in patients with IPF, with or without pulmonary hypertension (WHO Group 3), compared Letairis (N=329) to placebo (N=163). The study was terminated after 34 weeks for lack of efficacy and was found to demonstrate a greater risk of disease progression or death on Letairis. More patients taking Letairis died (8% vs. 4%), had a respiratory hospitalization (13% vs. 6%), and had a decrease in FVC/DLCO (17% vs. 12%). This section does not specifically mention liver toxicity but indicates overall adverse effects in a specific patient population.

6. **Patient Counseling Information (Section 17)**
   - **Hepatic Effects**: Advise patients of the symptoms of potential liver injury and instruct them to report any of these symptoms to their physician. This indicates that patients should be aware of potential liver injury symptoms while taking Letairis, suggesting a precautionary measure rather than a direct association.

### Conclusion
The drug label for Letairis (ambrisentan) includes several mentions of liver-related risks and precautions. However, the direct association of Letairis with liver toxicity is not strongly established. Most references to liver enzyme elevations or liver injury suggest alternative causes or a precautionary approach rather than a direct causative link to Letairis.",Less,No,,0,"The provided drug label for Letairis (ambrisentan) does not mention ototoxicity, auditory risks, or ototoxic reactions.

### Conclusion
QINLOCK (ripretinib) is associated with several hematological toxicities and reactions, including increased aPTT, INR, decreased neutrophil count, anemia, and various laboratory abnormalities such as increased lipase, decreased phosphate, and increased blood bilirubin. These associations highlight the need for careful monitoring of hematological parameters during treatment.",Most,Yes,1.0,1,"The drug label for QINLOCK (ripretinib) discusses infertility risks in the following sections:

1. **Section 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential:**
   - **Infertility:** 
     - ""Based on findings from animal studies, QINLOCK may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].""
     - **Summary:** This sentence indicates that the drug itself (QINLOCK) may impair fertility in males based on animal studies.

2. **Section 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:**
   - ""Dedicated fertility studies in male animals were not conducted with ripretinib. Findings in male reproductive organs occurred in repeat-dose toxicity studies and included degeneration of the testes and cellular debris of the epididymis in males administered ≥30 mg/kg/day (approximately one half of the human exposure at the recommended dose of 150 mg).""
     - **Summary:** This sentence indicates that the drug itself (ripretinib) caused degeneration of the testes and cellular debris of the epididymis in male animals in repeat-dose toxicity studies.

In summary, the drug label clearly associates QINLOCK (ripretinib) with potential infertility risks in males based on findings from animal studies and toxicity studies.",Most,Yes,1.0,1,"The drug label for QINLOCK (ripretinib) does not explicitly mention liver toxicity, liver injury, or hepatotoxicity risks and reactions in the sections provided. However, there are some references to liver-related laboratory abnormalities and pharmacokinetics in patients with hepatic impairment. Here is a summary of those points:

1. **Laboratory Abnormalities (Table 3)**
   - **Increased ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)**: 12% of patients experienced increased ALT levels, with 1.2% experiencing Grade 3-4 levels. This indicates liver enzyme elevation, which can be a marker of liver stress or damage. However, the label does not explicitly state that QINLOCK caused liver toxicity.

2. **Pharmacokinetics in Patients with Hepatic Impairment**
   - **Mild Hepatic Impairment**: No clinically significant changes in AUC (Area Under the Curve) and Cmax (maximum plasma concentration) were observed in subjects with mild hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. This suggests that mild liver impairment does not significantly affect the drug's pharmacokinetics, and there is no direct mention of liver toxicity caused by QINLOCK.
   - **Moderate Hepatic Impairment**: Ripretinib AUC increased 2-fold while Cmax was unchanged. The combined AUC of ripretinib and its active metabolite increased 1.5-fold. This indicates altered drug metabolism in moderate hepatic impairment but does not explicitly state that QINLOCK causes liver toxicity.
   - **Severe Hepatic Impairment**: Ripretinib AUC increased 2.6-fold, and Cmax decreased by 24%. The combined AUC of ripretinib and its active metabolite increased by 1.4-fold. The observed magnitude of increase in exposure is unlikely to be clinically relevant based on the known safety profile of ripretinib, suggesting no direct association with liver toxicity.
