    "Summary": "The molecule, 2-amino-9-[(1S,3R,4S)-4-hydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methylidenecyclopentyl]-1H-purin-6-one (a guanosine analog), is predicted to be toxic to the liver and kidneys, but not the lungs. Liver toxicity is suggested by the disruption of critical kinase and phosphatase signaling pathways, which can lead to hepatocyte apoptosis. Renal toxicity is indicated by the activation of p53-dependent DNA damage response pathways, a hallmark of genotoxic stress leading to kidney cell death. The molecule's structure as a nucleoside analog supports these mechanisms, as it is designed to interact with cellular phosphorylation and DNA synthesis machinery, leading to potential off-target effects in these organs. No evidence was provided to support pulmonary toxicity.",

                "GO Term: The provided GO terms (Transmembrane Receptor Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Activity, Protein Serine/Threonine/Tyrosine Kinase Activity) indicate interference with cellular phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Dysregulation of these fundamental signaling cascades is a known mechanism of drug-induced liver injury (DILI), as it can disrupt cell growth, proliferation, and survival, leading to hepatocyte apoptosis and inflammation.",
                "IUPAC Support: The structure is a guanosine analog. For its therapeutic action, it must be phosphorylated by host cellular kinases. This necessary interaction with the cell's phosphorylation machinery can lead to off-target effects, disrupting the delicate balance of kinase and phosphatase signaling networks, as suggested by the GO terms, thereby contributing to hepatotoxicity.",
                "Overall Mechanism: The compound, a guanosine analog, interacts with cellular kinases for its bioactivation. This interaction has the potential to dysregulate the broader kinase and phosphatase signaling network within hepatocytes. This disruption leads to cellular stress and apoptosis, culminating in drug-induced liver injury."

                "Pathway: The involvement of 'p53-Dependent G1 S DNA Damage Checkpoint' and 'p53-Dependent G1 DNA Damage Response' pathways is a strong indicator of genotoxicity. Activation of these pathways signifies that the compound is causing DNA damage in renal cells, leading to cell cycle arrest and potentially apoptosis to eliminate damaged cells.",

                "IUPAC Support: The molecule is a nucleoside analog designed to interfere with DNA synthesis. The kidneys are a major route of excretion for such drugs, leading to high concentrations in renal tubular cells. This accumulation can cause off-target effects on host cell DNA replication, which is recognized as DNA damage, thereby triggering the p53-mediated response identified in the pathway analysis.",
                "Overall Mechanism: As a nucleoside analog, the compound can accumulate in renal proximal tubules. Its interference with DNA synthesis is detected as DNA damage by the cell's surveillance machinery, activating the p53-dependent DNA damage response. This response triggers cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in renal tubular cells, leading to acute tubular injury and overall nephrotoxicity."
