This molecule is a racemic mixture of 2 diastereoisomers where dilevalol, the R,R' stereoisomer, makes up 25% of the mixture. This molecule is formulated as an injection or tablets to treat hypertension. This molecule was granted FDA approval on 1 August 1984. This molecule is a beta-Adrenergic Blocker. The mechanism of action of this molecule is as an Adrenergic beta-Antagonist. This molecule is an antihypertensive agent with both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blocking activity. This molecule has been linked to several cases of clinically apparent drug induced liver disease, some of which have been severe and even fatal. This molecule is a third generation selective alpha-1-adrenergic antagonist and non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist with vasodilatory and antihypertensive properties. This molecule competitively binds to alpha-1-adrenergic receptors in vascular smooth muscle, thereby inhibiting the adrenergic stimulation of endothelial cell function and vasoconstriction in peripheral blood vessels. This agent also binds to beta-receptors in the bronchial and vascular smooth muscle, resulting in a decrease in adrenergic stimulation. The result is a decrease in resting and exercise heart rates, cardiac output, and in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, thereby resulting in vasodilation, and negative chronotropic and inotropic cardiac effects. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 1984 and is indicated for cardiovascular disease and hypertension and has 10 investigational indications. This molecule is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a blocker of both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors that is used as an antihypertensive . This molecule HCl combines both selective, competitive, alpha-1-adrenergic blocking and nonselective, competitive, beta-adrenergic blocking activity in a single substance. In man, the ratios of alpha- to beta- blockade have been estimated to be approximately 1:3 and 1:7 following oral and intravenous administration, respectively. The principal physiologic action of this molecule is to competitively block adrenergic stimulation of &#946;-receptors within the myocardium and within bronchial and vascular smooth muscle , and &#945;1-receptors within vascular smooth muscle. This causes a decrease in systemic arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance without a substantial reduction in resting heart rate, cardiac output, or stroke volume, apparently because of its combined &#945;- and &#946;-adrenergic blocking activity. A salicylamide derivative that is a non-cardioselective blocker of BETA-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS and ALPHA-1 ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS."

This molecule is a prodrug belonging to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor class of medications. It is metabolized to ramiprilat in the liver and, to a lesser extent, kidneys. Ramiprilat is a potent, competitive inhibitor of ACE, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II . ATII regulates blood pressure and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system . This molecule may be used in the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, nephropathy, and to reduce the rate of death, myocardial infarction and stroke in individuals at high risk of cardiovascular events. This molecule is an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor. The mechanism of action of this molecule is as an Angiotensin-converting Enzyme Inhibitor. This molecule is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor used in the therapy of hypertension and heart failure. This molecule is associated with a low rate of transient serum aminotransferase elevations and has been linked to rare instances of acute liver injury. This molecule is a prodrug and nonsulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor with antihypertensive activity. This molecule is converted in the liver by de-esterification into its active form ramiprilat, which inhibits ACE, thereby blocking the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This abolishes the potent vasoconstrictive actions of angiotensin II and leads to vasodilatation. This agent also causes an increase in bradykinin levels and a decrease in angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex, thereby promoting diuresis and natriuresis. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 1991 and has 9 approved and 19 investigational indications. This drug has a black box warning from the FDA. A long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. It is a prodrug that is transformed in the liver to its active metabolite ramiprilat."

        "description": "This molecule is a sulfonamide, a member of isoindoles and a member of monochlorobenzenes. This molecule is a thiazide-like diuretic used for the treatment of hypertension and for management of edema caused by conditions such as heart failure or renal impairment. This molecule improves blood pressure and swelling by preventing water absorption from the kidneys through inhibition of the Na+/Cl\u2212 symporter in the distal convoluted tubule cells in the kidney. The exact mechanism of this molecule's anti-hypertensive effect is under debate, however, it is thought that increased diuresis results in decreased plasma and extracellular fluid volume, decreased cardiac output and therefore overall reduction in blood pressure. This molecule is considered first-line therapy for management of uncomplicated hypertension as there is strong evidence from meta-analyses that thiazide diuretics such as this molecule reduce the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension. In particular, the ALLHAT trial confirmed the role of thiazide diuretics as first-line therapy and demonstrated that this molecule had a statistically significant lower incidence of stroke and heart failure when compared to [DB00722], [DB00381], or [DB00590]. Further studies have indicated that low-dose thiazides are as good as, and in some secondary endpoints, better than \u03b2-blockers, ACE inhibitors, Calcium Channel Blockers or ARBs. This molecule has been shown to have a number of pleiotropic effects that differentiate it from other diuretics such as [DB00999]. In addition to its antihypertensive effects, this molecule has also been shown to decrease platelet aggregation and vascular permeability, as well as promote angiogenesis in vitro, which is thought to be partly the result of reductions in carbonic anhydrase\u2013dependent pathways. These pathways may play a role in this molecule's cardiovascular risk reduction effects. This molecule is a Thiazide-like Diuretic. The physiologic effect of this molecule is by means of Increased Diuresis. This molecule is a long acting thiazide-like diuretic of the sulfamoylbenzamide class that is devoid of the benzothiadiazine structure. This molecule directly inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption on the luminal membrane of the early segment in the distal convoluted tubule in the kidney. This leads to an increase in sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and potassium secretion resulting in the excretion of water. In addition, this agent, like other thiazide diuretics, decreases calcium and uric acid secretion. In addition, this agent inhibits many carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes. This molecule is used in the treatment of high blood pressure, edema and congestive heart failure. The elimination half-life is about 40 to 50 hours. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 1960 and has 9 approved and 12 investigational indications. A benzenesulfonamide-phthalimidine that tautomerizes to a BENZOPHENONES form. It is considered a thiazide-like diuretic."

This molecule is a long-acting benzodiazepine with anxiolytic, sedative and hypnotic activity. This molecule exerts its effect by binding to the benzodiazepine site at the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-chloride ionophore complex in the central nervous system . This leads to an increase in the opening of chloride channels, membrane hyperpolarization and increases the inhibitory effect of GABA on the CNS. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 1960 and has 3 approved and 2 investigational indications.

        "description": "This molecule is a semisynthetic opioid of formula C18H21NO4 that is derived from thebaine. It is a moderately potent opioid analgesic, generally used for relief of moderate to severe pain. It has a role as an opioid analgesic, a mu-opioid receptor agonist and an antitussive. It is an organic heteropentacyclic compound and a semisynthetic derivative. It is functionally related to a thebaine. It is a conjugate base of an this molecule. It derives from a hydride of a morphinan. This molecule is a DEA Schedule II controlled substance. Substances in the DEA Schedule II have a high potential for abuse which may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. This molecule is a semisynthetic opioid analgesic derived from thebaine in Germany in 1917. It is currently indicated as an immediate release product for moderate to severe pain and as an extended release product for chronic moderate to severe pain requiring continuous opioid analgesics for an extended period. The first this molecule containing product, Percodan, was approved by the FDA on April 12, 1950. This molecule is an Opioid Agonist. The mechanism of action of this molecule is as a Full Opioid Agonist. This molecule is a semisynthetic, moderately potent, orally available opioid that is widely used for acute or chronic management of moderate- or moderately severe pain either alone or in combination with acetaminophen. This molecule by itself has not been linked to serum enzyme elevations during therapy or to clinically apparent liver injury. However, the combination of this molecule with acetaminophen has been linked to many cases of acute liver failure caused by unintentional overdose with acetaminophen. This molecule has been reported in Papaver somniferum with data available. This molecule is a semi-synthetic, morphine-like opioid alkaloid with analgesic activity. This molecule exerts its analgesic activity by binding to the mu-receptors in the central nervous system , thereby mimicking the effects of endogenous opioids. Binding of the opiate receptor stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex and inhibits adenylate cyclase, thereby preventing cAMP production. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters, such as substance P, gamma-aminobutyric acid , dopamine, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline, is inhibited. This molecule also inhibits the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin, and glucagon. In addition, this molecule closes N-type voltage-gated calcium channels and opens G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels resulting in hyperpolarization and reduction of neuronal excitability. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 1950 and has 4 approved and 29 investigational indications. This drug has a black box warning from the FDA. This molecule is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a semisynthetic derivative of codeine that acts as a narcotic analgesic more potent and addicting than codeine. This molecule acts as a weak agonist at mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors within the central nervous system . This molecule primarily affects mu-type opioid receptors, which are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as modulators, both positive and negative, of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine, and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids such as this molecule also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin, and glucagon. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels . This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability.

It is a lipopeptide and a polypeptide. This molecule contains this molecule, a synthetic analog of human glucagon-like peptide-1 and acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist. This molecule is 97% similar to native human GLP-1, differing primarily by substituting arginine for lysine at position 34. This molecule is made by attaching a C-16 fatty acid with a glutamic acid spacer on the remaining lysine residue at position 26 of the peptide precursor. This molecule was granted FDA approval on January 25, 2010. This molecule is a GLP-1 Receptor Agonist. The mechanism of action of this molecule is as a Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Agonist. This molecule is a recombinant DNA produced polypeptide analogue of human glucagon-like peptide-1 which is used in combination with diet and exercise in the therapy of type 2 diabetes, either alone or in combination with other antidiabetic agents. There have been no published reports of hepatotoxicity attributed to this molecule therapy. This molecule is a long-acting, fatty acylated glucagon-like peptide-1 analog administered subcutaneously, with antihyperglycemic activity. This molecule's prolonged action and half-life of 11-15 hours are attributed to the attachment of the fatty acid palmitic acid to GLP-1 that reversibly binds to albumin. Albumin binding protects this molecule from immediate degradation and elimination and causes GLP-1 to be released from abumin in a slow and consistent manner. This agent may cause thyroid C-cell tumors and increases the risk of acute pancreatitis. This molecule is a Protein drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 2010 and has 5 approved and 19 investigational indications.

        "description": "This molecule is a glucocorticoid steroid having a highly oxygenated pregna-1,4-diene structure. It is used mainly in the treatment of asthma and non-infectious rhinitis and for treatment and prevention of nasal polyposis. It has a role as an anti-inflammatory drug, a bronchodilator agent and a drug allergen. It is an 11beta-hydroxy steroid, a glucocorticoid, a cyclic acetal, a 20-oxo steroid, a 21-hydroxy steroid, a 3-oxo-Delta,Delta-steroid and a primary alpha-hydroxy ketone. It derives from a hydride of a pregnane. This molecule is a glucocorticoid that is a mix of the 22R and 22S epimer used to treat inflammatory conditions of the lungs and intestines such as asthma, COPD, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. This molecule was granted FDA approval on 14 February 1994. It is also available in a combination product with [formoterol]. This molecule is a Corticosteroid. The mechanism of action of this molecule is as a Corticosteroid Hormone Receptor Agonist. This molecule is a corticosteroid that undergoes high first pass elimination by the liver so that systemic levels after oral administration are minimal. This molecule has been used orally for several immune mediated gastrointestinal and liver diseases and as nasal spray or by inhalation for allergic rhinitis, asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease. Neither inhalant nor oral this molecule has been linked to serum enzyme elevations during therapy or to convincing instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury. This molecule is a synthetic glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties. Upon administration, this molecule binds to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors and induces the expression of glucocorticoid-responsive genes that encode for anti-inflammatory mediators, such as certain anti-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 10 , and lipocortins. Lipocortins inhibit phospholipase A2, thereby blocking the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids and preventing the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, both mediators of inflammation. In addition, this molecule prevents the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from epithelial cells and macrophages, including interleukin 6 , IL-8, interferon-beta , and inhibits nuclear factor kappa-B activation thereby decreasing NF-kB-mediated inflammation. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 1994 and has 12 approved and 35 investigational indications. This drug has a black box warning from the FDA. A glucocorticoid used in the management of ASTHMA, the treatment of various skin disorders, and allergic RHINITIS."

        "description": "This molecule is a steroid ester. This molecule is the ester prodrug of [testosterone] and has a mid-chain fatty acid at the carbon 17\u03b2 position. It was developed via fatty acid esterification of testosterone in order to achieve orally administer testosterone. There are oral and intramuscular formulations available for this molecule: both formulations are indicated for testosterone replacement therapy in adult males with hypogonadism. Testosterone is a critical male hormone that is responsible for the normal growth and development of the male sex organs and for the maintenance of secondary sex characteristics. Male hypogonadism, resulting from insufficient testosterone secretion, can result symptoms and signs of testosterone deficiency, such as decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and loss of muscle and bone mass. Testosterone replacement therapy aims to restore the levels of testosterone, thereby improving symptoms and signs of testosterone deficiency. This molecule is the undecanoate ester form of the androgen testosterone, with gonadotropin-secretory inhibiting and hormone replacement activity. As testosterone inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins from the pituitary gland, administration of testosterone decreases the secretion of luteinizing hormone . By inhibiting LH secretion, the growth of Leydig cells, which are normally stimulated by LH to produce testosterone, may be suppressed. In addition, this agent promotes the maintenance of male sex characteristics and can be used for testosterone replacement in hypogonadal males. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 2014 and has 5 approved and 7 investigational indications. This drug has a black box warning from the FDA."

        "description": "This molecule is an azamacrocycle consisting of two cyclam rings connected by a 1,4-phenylenebis linker. It is a CXCR4 chemokine receptor antagonist and a hematopoietic stem cell mobilizer. It is used in combination with grulocyte-colony stimulating factor to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells to the perpheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma. It has a role as an immunological adjuvant, an antineoplastic agent, an anti-HIV agent and a C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 antagonist. It is an azamacrocycle, a crown amine, a secondary amino compound, an azacycloalkane, a tertiary amino compound and a member of benzenes. It is functionally related to a 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane. This molecule is a small-molecule inhibitor of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 that acts as a hematopoietic stem cell mobilizer. It is used to stimulate the release of stem cells from the bone marrow into the blood in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma to stimulate their immune system. These stem cells are then collected and used in autologous stem cell transplantation to replace blood-forming cells destroyed by chemotherapy. As an inhibitor of CXCR4, this molecule blocks the binding of its ligand, stromal cell-derived factor-1-alpha . Since CXCR4 and SDF-1\u03b1 are involved in the trafficking and homing of CD34+ cells to the marrow compartment, blocking this interaction leads to an increase in CD34+ cell circulating levels. Compared to placebo with G-CSF, the this molecule and G-CSF mobilization regimen has a higher probability of achieving the optimal CD34+ cell target for tandem transplantation in fewer apheresis procedures. This molecule has orphan drug status in the United States and European Union and was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on December 15, 2008. This molecule is a Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilizer. The physiologic effect of this molecule is by means of Increased Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization. This molecule is a small molecular antagonist of the cell-surface CXCR4 receptor that plays an important role in mobilization of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to the stroma of the bone marrow; blocking the receptor helps to mobilize stem cells from the marrow to peripheral blood allowing for collection of these cells by apheresis for hematopoietic cell transplantation. This molecule is generally well tolerated and has not been linked to serum enzyme elevations or to clinically apparent liver injury. This molecule is a bicyclam with hematopoietic stem cell-mobilizing activity. This molecule blocks the binding of stromal cell-derived factor to the cellular receptor CXCR4, resulting in hematopoietic stem cell release from bone marrow and HSC movement into the peripheral circulation. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 2008 and has 6 approved and 30 investigational indications."

        "description": "This molecule is an aromatic ether consisting of 4-trifluoromethylphenol in which the hydrogen of the phenolic hydroxy group is replaced by a 3--1-phenylpropyl group. It is a member of benzenes, an aromatic ether and a secondary amino compound. This molecule is a 2nd generation antidepressant categorized as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor . It gained FDA approval in 1987 and although it was initially intended for the treatment of depression, today it is commonly prescribed to manage depression in addition to various other pathologies. This molecule is a Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor. The mechanism of action of this molecule is as a Serotonin Uptake Inhibitor. This molecule is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor widely used as an antidepressant. This molecule therapy can be associated with transient asymptomatic elevations in serum aminotransferase levels and has been linked to rare instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury. This molecule has been reported in Hordeum vulgare with data available. This molecule is a diphenhydramine derivative and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor with antidepressant, anti-anxiety, antiobsessional and antibulimic activity and with potential immunomodulating activity. Upon administration, this molecule binds to the presynaptic serotonin receptor resulting in negative allosteric modulation of the receptor complex, thereby blocking recycling of serotonin by the presynaptic receptor. Inhibition of serotonin reuptake by this molecule enhances serotonergic function through serotonin accumulation in the synaptic space, resulting in long-term desensitization and downregulation of 5-HT receptors, preventing 5-HT-mediated signaling and leading to antidepressant, anti-anxiety, antiobsessional and antibulimic effects. In addition, this molecule may inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 . This may prevent IL-6-mediated inflammation and cytokine storm. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 1987 and has 4 approved and 36 investigational indications. This drug has a black box warning from the FDA. This molecule hydrochloride is the first agent of the class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors . This molecule is a racemic mixture of the R- and S- enantiomers and are of equivalent pharmacologic activity. Despite distinct structural differences between compounds in this class, SSRIs possess similar pharmacological activity. As with other antidepressant agents, several weeks of therapy may be required before a clinical effect is seen. SSRIs are potent inhibitors of neuronal serotonin reuptake. They have little to no effect on norepinephrine or dopamine reuptake and do not antagonize &alpha;- or &beta;-adrenergic, dopamine D<sub>2</sub> or histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors. During acute use, SSRIs block serotonin reuptake and increase serotonin stimulation of somatodendritic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and terminal autoreceptors. Chronic use leads to desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and terminal autoreceptors. The overall clinical effect of increased mood and decreased anxiety is thought to be due to adaptive changes in neuronal function that leads to enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission. Side effects include dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, sexual dysfunction and headache. Side effects generally occur within the first two weeks of therapy and are usually less severe and frequent than those observed with tricyclic antidepressants. This molecule may be used to treat major depressive disorder , moderate to severe bulimia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder , premenstrual dysphoric disorder , panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, and in combination with olanzapine for treatment-resistant or bipolar I depression. This molecule is the most anorexic and stimulating SSRI. The first highly specific serotonin uptake inhibitor. It is used as an antidepressant and often has a more acceptable side-effects profile than traditional antidepressants."

        "description": "LSM-5397 is a milbemycin. This molecule is a semi-synthetic antiparasitic medication derived from avermectins, a class of highly-active broad-spectrum antiparasitic agents isolated from the fermentation products of Streptomyces avermitilis. This molecule itself is a mixture of two avermectins, comprising roughly 90% this molecule and 10% 5-O-demethyl-25-de-22,23-dihydro\u00ad-25-avermectin A1a . This molecule is mainly used in humans in the treatment of onchocerciasis, but may also be effective against other worm infestations . Applied topically, it may be used in the treatment of head lice infestation. With the advent of 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, this molecule began garnering notoriety due to its off-label use for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. While studies are still ongoing, much of the evidence for this molecule in COVID-19 relies on pre-print in vitro data, and the clinical utility of this data remains unclear. Due to a number of factors - for example, the relatively low number of patients per trial and the speed at which these trials were conducted - studies on the use of this molecule in COVID-19 have been fraught with statistical errors and accusations of plagiarism. In addition, the use of aggregate patient data in large-scale meta-analyses ) has been shown to disguise otherwise blatant data errors, such as extreme terminal digit bias and the duplication of blocks of patient records. Until high-quality, peer-reviewed data regarding both the safety and efficacy of this molecule for COVID-19 in humans becomes available, the use of this molecule for these purposes should be avoided in favour of thoroughly-vetted therapies ). This molecule is an Antiparasitic and Pediculicide. This molecule is an antiinfective agent with activity against several parasitic nematodes and scabies and is the treatment of choice for onchocerciasis . It is typically given as one or two oral doses. This molecule therapy has been associated with minor, self-limiting serum aminotransferase elevations and very rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury. This molecule B1a has been reported in Streptomyces avermitilis with data available. This molecule is an orally bioavailable macrocyclic lactone derived from Streptomyces avermitilis, with antiparasitic and potential anti-viral activities. Upon administration, this molecule exerts its anthelmintic effect through binding and activating glutamate-gated chloride channels expressed on nematode neurons and pharyngeal muscle cells. This causes increased permeability of chloride ions, causing a state of hyperpolarization and results in the paralysis and death of the parasite. This molecule may exerts its antiviral effect, including its potential activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 , by binding to the importin alpha/beta1 heterodimer, which is responsible for the nuclear import of viral proteins such as the integrase protein. This inhibits nuclear import of host and viral proteins and may inhibit viral replication. This molecule is a component of this molecule, a broad-spectrum antiparasitic avermectin medicine.

This molecule is an N-acyl-amino acid that is a form of the water-soluble this molecule. Its biologically active forms are essential for nucleotide biosynthesis and homocysteine remethylation. It has a role as a human metabolite, a nutrient and a mouse metabolite. It is a member of this molecule acids and a N-acyl-amino acid. It is functionally related to a pteroic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a this molecule. This molecule, also known as this molecule or this molecule, is a member of the B vitamin family and an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, this molecule is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. This molecule is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize this molecule endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. For example, this molecule is present in green vegetables, beans, avocado, and some fruits. In order to function within the body, this molecule must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase into the cofactors dihydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate . This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as [DB00563] as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF. When used in high doses such as for cancer therapy, or in low doses such as for Rheumatoid Arthritis or psoriasis, [DB00563] impedes the body's ability to create this molecule. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects. As a result, supplementation with 1-5mg of this molecule is recommended to prevent deficiency and a number of side effects associated with MTX therapy including mouth ulcers and gastrointestinal irritation. [DB00650] supplementation is typically used for high-dose MTX regimens for the treatment of cancer. Levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate and are able to bypass DHFR reduction to act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF. There are also several antiepileptic drugs that are associated with reduced serum and red blood cell this molecule, including [DB00564] , [DB00252] , or barbiturates. This molecule is therefore often provided as supplementation to individuals using these medications, particularly to women of child-bearing age. Inadequate this molecule levels can result in a number of health concerns including cardiovascular disease, megaloblastic anemias, cognitive deficiencies, and neural tube defects . This molecule is typically supplemented during pregnancy to prevent the development of NTDs and in individuals with alcoholism to prevent the development of neurological disorders, for example. This molecule is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli . This molecule is a collective term for pteroylglutamic acids and their oligoglutamic acid conjugates. As a natural water-soluble substance, this molecule is involved in carbon transfer reactions of amino acid metabolism, in addition to purine and pyrimidine synthesis, and is essential for hematopoiesis and red blood cell production. this molecule is a cofactor for 1-carbon transfer involved with DNA synthesis. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV and has 10 approved and 62 investigational indications. This molecule is a member of the vitamin B family that stimulates the hematopoietic system. It is present in the liver and kidney and is found in mushrooms, spinach, yeast, green leaves, and grasses . This molecule, being biochemically inactive, is converted to tetrahydrofolic acid and methyltetrahydrofolate by dihydrofolate reductase. These this molecule congeners are transported across cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis where they are needed to maintain normal erythropoiesis, synthesize purine and thymidylate nucleic acids, interconvert amino acids, methylated tRNA, and generate and use formate. This molecule is used in the treatment and prevention of this molecule deficiencies and megaloblastic anemia. A member of the vitamin B family that stimulates the hematopoietic system.

It has a role as a hypoglycemic agent, an anti-arrhythmia drug, an EC 2.7.1.33 inhibitor and an EC 3.6.3.49 inhibitor. It is a N-sulfonylurea and a member of monochlorobenzenes. This molecule is a second generation sulfonylurea used to treat patients with diabetes mellitus type II. It is typically given to patients who cannot be managed with the standard first line therapy, [metformin]. This molecule stimulates insulin secretion through the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels on beta cells, raising intracellular potassium and calcium ion concentrations. This molecule was granted FDA approval on 1 May 1984. A formulation with metformin was granted FDA approval on on 31 July 2000. This molecule is a Sulfonylurea. This molecule is a sulfonamide urea derivative with antihyperglycemic activity that can potentially be used to decrease cerebral edema. Upon administration, this molecule binds to and blocks the sulfonylurea receptor type 1 subunit of the ATP-sensitive inwardly-rectifying potassium ) channels on the membranes of pancreatic beta cells. This prevents the inward current flow of positively charged potassium ions into the cell, and induces a calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels, which triggers exocytosis of insulin-containing granules. In addition, this molecule also inhibits the SUR1-regulated nonselective cation Ca-ATP channel, melastatin 4 ), thereby preventing capillary failure and brain swelling. SUR1-TRPM4 channels are formed by co-assembly of SUR1 with TRPM4 in neurons, astrocytes, and capillary endothelium during cerebral ischemia. Upon ischemia-induced ATP depletion, channels open which results in sodium influx, cytotoxic edema formation, capillary fragmentation and necrotic cell death. SUR1-TRPM4 is not expressed in normal, uninjured tissues. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 1984 and is indicated for type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetes mellitus and has 7 investigational indications. An antidiabetic sulfonylurea derivative with actions like those of chlorpropamide."

        "description": "This molecule is a dihydroxy monocarboxylic acid that is -7-[2-cyclopropyl-4-quinolin-3-yl]hept-6-enoic acid in which the two hydroxy groups are located at positions 3 and 5 . Used as its calcium salt for treatment of hypercholesterolemia on patients unable to sufficiently lower their cholesterol levels by diet and exercise. It has a role as an antioxidant. It is a member of quinolines, a dihydroxy monocarboxylic acid, a member of cyclopropanes, a statin and a member of monofluorobenzenes. It is a conjugate acid of a this molecule. This molecule, also known as the brand name product Livalo, is a lipid-lowering drug belonging to the statin class of medications. By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol within the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A Reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein , and very low-density lipoprotein . Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America. This molecule and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia. Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease , which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world. Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD. Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality. Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack. Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks. While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels. Study data has confirmed that this molecule's potency in lowering LDL-C is comparable to that of other statins but also has increased efficacy in increasing HDL-C . Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins. This molecule is a HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitor. The mechanism of action of this molecule is as a Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitor. This molecule is a relatively newly developed cholesterol lowering agent that is associated with mild, asymptomatic and self-limited serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy, but has had limited use and has yet to be linked with clinically apparent acute liver injury. This molecule is a novel statin that induces plaque regression and elevates HDL-cholesterol levels. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 2009 and has 5 approved and 10 investigational indications."

This molecule is an ethanolamine compound having a methyl group at the 1-position and an N-isopropyl substituent. It has a role as a beta-adrenergic antagonist, an anti-arrhythmia drug, an antihypertensive agent, a sympatholytic agent, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant. It is a member of ethanolamines, a monocarboxylic acid amide and a propanolamine. This molecule is a cardioselective beta-blocker used in a variety of cardiovascular conditions. Sir James Black, a Scottish pharmacologist, pioneered the use of beta-blockers for the management of angina pectoris in 1958 for which he received the Nobel Prize. Beta-blockers quickly became popular in clinical use and where subsequently investigated for use in myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and hypertension during the 1960s. Later they continued to be investigated for use in heart failure throughout the 1970-1980s. This molecule itself was developed early on in this history by Alvogen Malta under the trade name this molecule and received FDA approval in September, 1981. Despite being one of the most widely prescribed beta blockers, evidence suggests this molecule may not significantly reduce mortality, and only modestly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension. A Cochrane review of patients being treated for primary hypertension shows that this molecule shows a risk ratio of 0.88 for cardiovascular disease risk and a risk ratio of 0.99 for mortality. Similar results have been found in other meta-analyses. A meta-analysis of over 145,000 patients showed the risk of stroke in patients taking this molecule may depend on the age of the patient. The use of this molecule may need to be based on more patient factors than hypertension alone. This molecule is a beta-Adrenergic Blocker. The mechanism of action of this molecule is as an Adrenergic beta-Antagonist. This molecule is a cardioselective beta-blocker that is widely used in the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. This molecule has been linked to rare cases of drug induced liver injury, some of which have been fatal. This molecule is a synthetic isopropylamino-propanol derivative used as an antihypertensive, hypotensive and antiarrhythmic this molecule acts as a peripheral, cardioselective beta blocker specific for beta-1 adrenergic receptors, without intrinsic sympathomimetic effects. It reduces exercise heart rates and delays atrioventricular conduction, with overall oxygen requirements decreasing. this molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 1981 and has 7 approved and 13 investigational indications. This drug has a black box warning from the FDA. This molecule is a so-called beta1-selective drug. That means that it exerts greater blocking activity on myocardial beta1-receptors than on beta2 ones in the lung. The beta2 receptors are responsible to keep the bronchial system open. If these receptors are blocked, bronchospasm with serious lack of oxygen in the body can result. However, due to its cardioselective properties, the risk of bronchospastic reactions if using this molecule is reduced compared to nonselective drugs as propranolol. Nonetheless, this reaction may also be encountered with this molecule, particularly with high doses. Extreme caution should be exerted if this molecule is given to asthma patients, who are particularly at risk; the dose should be as low as possible. If an asthma attack occurs, the inhalation of a beta2-mimetic antiasthmatic, such as hexoprenalin or salbutamol, will usually suppress the symptoms. This molecule can be used to treat cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, arrhythmias, and treatment of myocardial infarction after the acute event. Patients with compensated congestive heart failure may be treated with this molecule as a co medication . In patients with congestive heart failure, it reduces the need for and the consumption of oxygen of the heart muscle. It is very important to start with low doses, as this molecule reduces also the muscular power of the heart, which is an undesired effect in congestive heart failure. A cardioselective beta-1 adrenergic blocker possessing properties and potency similar to PROPRANOLOL, but without a negative inotropic effect."

        "description": "This molecule is an aza-steroid that is a synthetic drug for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. It has a role as an androgen antagonist, an EC 1.3.1.22 [3-oxo-5alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenase )] inhibitor and an antihyperplasia drug. It is an aza-steroid, a 3-oxo steroid and a delta-lactam. It derives from a hydride of a 5alpha-androstane. This molecule is a synthetic 4-azasteroid compound and specific inhibitor of steroid Type II 5\u03b1-reductase, which is an intracellular enzyme that converts the androgen testosterone into 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone . It works in a similar fashion as [dutasteride], which is another 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, by exerting antiandrogenic effects. This molecule is an orally active drug that was first approved by the FDA in 1992 for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia to improve symptoms and reduce the risk for acute urinary retention or the need for surgical procedures. In 1998, it was approved by the FDA to treat male pattern hair loss. This molecule is commonly marketed under the brand names this molecule and this molecule to be used aloneo or in combination with [doxazosin], an alpha-blocker. Both benign prostatic hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia are androgen-dependent disorders that are characterized by in situ high levels of DHT. In the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia, alpha-blockers such as [tamsulosin] and [terazosin] are also used. Compared to alpha-blockers that focus on providing the rapid relief of symptoms, 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors aim to target the underlying disease by blocking the effects of the primary androgen involved in benign prostate hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia, thus reducing the risk for secondary complications while providing symptom control. This molecule is a 5-alpha Reductase Inhibitor. The mechanism of action of this molecule is as a 5-alpha Reductase Inhibitor. This molecule is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor used to treat symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy and male pattern baldness. This molecule is associated with a low rate of transient serum aminotransferase elevations, but has yet to be linked to instances of clinically apparent, acute liver injury. This molecule is a synthetic 4-azasteroid compound. This molecule competitively binds to and inhibits steroid type II 5-alpha-reductase in the prostate gland, liver, and skin, thereby interfering with the enzymatic conversion of testosterone to 5-dihydrotestosterone and reducing serum DHT levels. The reduction in serum DHT levels results in diminished stimulation of androgen receptors in the nuclei of prostate cells and, so, diminished prostate cell proliferation. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 1992 and has 6 approved and 6 investigational indications. An orally active testosterone 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor. It is used as a surgical alternative for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. An orally active 3-OXO-5-ALPHA-STEROID 4-DEHYDROGENASE inhibitor. It is used as a surgical alternative for treatment of benign PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA."

        "description": "This molecule can cause developmental toxicity according to state or federal government labeling requirements. This molecule is a benzothiadiazine that is the S,S-dioxide of 2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine which is substituted at position 3 by a methyl group and at position 7 by chlorine. A peripheral vasodilator, it increases the concentration of glucose in the plasma and inhibits the secretion of insulin by the beta- cells of the pancreas. It is used orally in the management of intractable hypoglycaemia and intravenously in the management of hypertensive emergencies. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent, a sodium channel blocker, a vasodilator agent, a K-ATP channel agonist, a beta-adrenergic agonist, a cardiotonic drug, a bronchodilator agent, a sympathomimetic agent and a diuretic. It is a benzothiadiazine, a sulfone and an organochlorine compound. This molecule is a non-diuretic benzothiadiazine derivative that activates ATP-sensitive potassium channels. It is chemically related to thiazide diuretics but does not inhibit carbonic anhydrase and does not have chloriuretic or natriuretic activity. This molecule is commonly used in the treatment of hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycemia due to its ability to inhibit insulin release. This molecule also exhibits hypotensive activity and reduces arteriolar smooth muscle and vascular resistance. When administered intravenously, this molecule can be used to treat hypertensive emergencies; however, this specific form of this molecule is no longer available in the US. This molecule is usually well tolerated, and some of its more common side effects include fluid retention and electrolyte disturbances. In September 2015, the FDA issued a safety alert regarding post-marketing reports of pulmonary hypertension occurring in infants and neonates. This molecule is a benzothiadiazine derivate with antihypertensive and hyperglycemic activities. This molecule increases membrane permeability to potassium ions in vascular smooth muscle, thereby stabilizing the membrane action potential and preventing vascular smooth muscle contraction; this results in peripheral vasodilatation and decreases in peripheral vascular resistance. This agent also inhibits insulin release by interacting with ATP-sensitive potassium channels of pancreatic islet beta-cells. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 1973 and has 4 approved and 6 investigational indications. A benzothiadiazine derivative that is a peripheral vasodilator used for hypertensive emergencies. It lacks diuretic effect, apparently because it lacks a sulfonamide group."

An antihypertensive agent, it is used in the treatment of high blood pressure. It has a role as an antihypertensive agent, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, an antineoplastic agent, a vasodilator agent and an antihyperplasia drug. It is a member of quinazolines, a N-acylpiperazine, a N-arylpiperazine, a benzodioxine, a monocarboxylic acid amide and an aromatic amine. This molecule is an alpha-1 antagonist used for the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy symptoms and hypertension. Other members of this drug class include [Prazosin], [Terazosin], [Tamsulosin], and [Alfuzosin]. Because of its long-lasting effects, this molecule can be administered once a day. It is marketed by Pfizer and was initially approved by the FDA in 1990. This molecule is an alpha-Adrenergic Blocker. The mechanism of action of this molecule is as an Adrenergic alpha-Antagonist. This molecule is a nonselective alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist used in the therapy of hypertension and benign prostatic hypertrophy. This molecule is associated with a low rate of transient serum aminotransferase elevations, but has not been linked to instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury. This molecule is a quinazoline with antihypertensive and antineoplastic properties. This molecule is an alpha-adrenergic antagonist that selectively inhibits alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. Blockages of the alpha-1 adrenergic action on the vascular smooth muscles lead to a decrease in vascular resistance and antihypertensive activity. This agent also shows high affinity to alpha-1c adrenoceptor, the predominant functional type in the prostate, which may partially attribute to its effect in treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Furthermore, this molecule induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells mediated through inhibition of protein kinase B /Akt-signaling death receptor regulatory pathway. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 1990 and has 3 approved and 15 investigational indications. A prazosin-related compound that is a selective alpha-1-adrenergic blocker."

This molecule is an antiepileptic agent that is an aromatic allylic alcohol drug, which makes it structurally unique from other antiepileptic drugs. The clinical development and marketing of this molecule were first delayed due to the drug's potent inhibitory effects on hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes. However, its clinical efficacy as adjunctive therapy for epilepsies stems from its inhibitory action on CYP enzymes, as this molecule reduces the degradation of CYP-sensitive antiepileptic drugs, hence boosting their therapeutic efficacy. This molecule may also exhibit direct anticonvulsant properties, although the exact mechanism of action is fully understood. Approved in the US, Canada, and Europe, this molecule is used to treat seizures associated with Dravet syndrome. It is marketed under the brand name this molecule. This molecule is a structurally unique anticonvulsant that has been introduced as adjuvant therapy of Dravet syndrome, a rare form of severe childhood epilepsy. There is limited information on the safety of this molecule, but it has not been associated with serum aminotransferase elevations or linked to cases of clinically apparent liver injury. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 2007 and has 3 approved and 2 investigational indications."

It binds to the serotonin reuptake pump, causing inhbition of serotonin uptake and release of serotonin. The resulting increased levels of serotonin lead to greater serotonin receptor activation which in turn lead to enhancement of serotoninergic transmission in the centres of feeding behavior located in the hypothalamus. This suppresses the appetite for carbohydrates. This molecule was used as the hydrochloride for treatment of diabetes and obesity. It was withdrawn worldwide after reports of heart valve disease and pulmonary hypertension. It has a role as a serotonin uptake inhibitor, a serotonergic agonist and an appetite depressant. It is a secondary amino compound and a member of benzenes. Dravet syndrome is a pediatric encephalopathy that typically manifests within the first year of life following exposure to elevated temperatures. It is characterized by recurrent pharmacoresistant seizures, which increase in frequency and severity with disease progression. Concomitantly with these seizures, patients typically display delayed development and neurocognitive impairment. This molecule is a serotonergic phenethylamine originally used as an appetite suppressant until concerns regarding cardiotoxicity in obese patients lead to its withdrawal from the market in 1997. Through its ability to modulate neurotransmission, this molecule has reemerged as an effective therapy against pharmacoresistant seizures, such as those involved in Dravet syndrome. This molecule was granted initial FDA approval in 1973 prior to its withdrawal; it was granted a new FDA approval on June 25, 2020, for treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome through the restricted this molecule REMS program. It is currently sold under the name this molecule\u00ae by Zogenix INC. This molecule is an amphetamine derivative and a sympathomimetic stimulant with appetite-suppressant property. This molecule, which was part of the Fen-Phen anti-obesity medication, stimulates the release of serotonin from vesicular storage, and modulates serotonin transporter function. Since serotonin regulates mood and appetite, among other functions, increased serotonin level results in a feeling of fullness and loss of appetite. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 1963 and has 3 approved and 3 investigational indications. This drug has a black box warning from the FDA. A centrally active drug that apparently both blocks serotonin uptake and provokes transport-mediated serotonin release."

The principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant, it is used for treatment of anorexia associated with AIDS as well as nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. It has a role as a metabolite, a non-narcotic analgesic, a hallucinogen, a cannabinoid receptor agonist and an epitope. It is a diterpenoid, a benzochromene, a polyketide and a phytocannabinoid. This molecule is a DEA Schedule II controlled substance. Substances in the DEA Schedule II have a high potential for abuse which may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. It is a Hallucinogenic substances substance. This molecule is a synthetic form of this molecule , the primary psychoactive component of cannabis . This molecule demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 and Cannabinoid-2 receptors, which results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes. Due to its evidence as an appetite stimulant and an anti-nauseant, this molecule is approved for use in anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS and for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments. This molecule and cannabidiol are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body. While both CBD and this molecule are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form , this molecule and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A and cannabidiolic acid , through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers. From a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body. The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. CB2 receptors are mainly located in the peripheral nervous system and can be found on lymphoid tissue where they are involved in regulation of immune function. This molecule is a Cannabinoid. This molecule is an orally available cannabinoid agonist that is used to treat nausea and vomiting and to stimulate appetite, particularly in patients with wasting disease or cachexia. This molecule is associated with a minimal rate of serum enzyme elevations during therapy and has not been linked to cases of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice. This molecule has been reported in Cannabis sativa with data available. This molecule is an isomer of this molecule that is the main and most active isomer found in the Cannabis sativa L. Plant, with potential anti-emetic, analgesic and appetite stimulating activities. Upon administration, this molecule, also called this molecule, targets and binds to cannabinoid receptors located in the central nervous system . This molecule acts directly on the appetite and vomiting control centers in the brain to stimulate appetite and prevent emesis. In addition, this agent induces analgesia. Urine levels may be used as a marker to determine the exposure to certain preparations containing parts of the cannabis plant, such as marijuana.

Used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. It has a role as a CFTR potentiator and an orphan drug. It is a quinolone, a member of phenols, an aromatic amide and a monocarboxylic acid amide. This molecule is a drug used for the management of Cystic Fibrosis . It is manufactured and distributed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on January 31, 2012, and by Health Canada in late 2012. This molecule is administered as a monotherapy and also administered in combination with other drugs for the management of CF. Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by one of several different mutations in the gene for the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator protein, an ion channel involved in the transport of chloride and sodium ions across cell membranes. CFTR is active in epithelial cells of organs such as of the lungs, pancreas, liver, digestive system, and reproductive tract. Alterations in the CFTR gene result in altered production, misfolding, or function of the protein and consequently abnormal fluid and ion transport across cell membranes. As a result, CF patients produce thick, sticky mucus that clogs the ducts of organs where it is produced making patients more susceptible to complications such as infections, lung damage, pancreatic insufficiency, and malnutrition. Prior to the development of this molecule, management of CF primarily involved therapies for the control of infections, nutritional support, clearance of mucus, and management of symptoms rather than improvements in the underlying disease process or lung function . Notably, this molecule was the first medication approved for the management of the underlying causes of CF rather than control of symptoms. This molecule is a this molecule. The mechanism of action of this molecule is as a Chloride Channel Activation Potentiator, and Cytochrome P450 2C9 Inhibitor, and P-Glycoprotein Inhibitor, and Cytochrome P450 3A Inhibitor. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 2012 and is indicated for respiratory system disease and cystic fibrosis and has 6 investigational indications."

        "description": "This molecule is a member of the class of aminopyrimidines that is 2,6-diamino-5-chloropyrimidine in which the amino groups at positions 2 and 6 are respectively carrying 2-methoxy-4--5-methylphenyl and 2-phenyl substituents. Used for the treatment of ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and an EC 2.7.10.1 inhibitor. It is an aminopyrimidine, an aromatic ether, an organochlorine compound, a secondary amino compound, a member of piperidines and a sulfone. This molecule is used for the treatment of adults with anaplastic lymphoma kinase -positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer following failure of prior crizotinib therapy. About 4% of patients with NSCLC have a chromosomal rearrangement that generates a fusion gene between EML4 and ALK , which results in constitutive kinase activity that contributes to carcinogenesis and seems to drive the malignant phenotype. This molecule exerts its therapeutic effect by inhibiting autophosphorylation of ALK, ALK-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream signaling protein STAT3, and proliferation of ALK-dependent cancer cells. Following treatment with crizotinib , most tumours develop drug resistance due to mutations in key \"gatekeeper\" residues of the enzyme. This occurrence led to development of novel second-generation ALK inhibitors such as this molecule to overcome crizotinib resistance. The FDA approved this molecule in April 2014 due to a surprisingly high response rate towards crizotinib-resistant tumours and has designated it with orphan drug status. This molecule is a Kinase Inhibitor. The mechanism of action of this molecule is as a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, and Cytochrome P450 3A Inhibitor, and Cytochrome P450 2C9 Inhibitor. This molecule is a small molecule tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor and antineoplastic agent that is used in the therapy of selected forms of advanced non-small cell lung cancer . This molecule is associated with a moderate rate of serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy and rare instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury. This molecule is an orally available inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity of anaplastic lymphoma kinase with antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, this molecule binds to and inhibits wild-type ALK kinase, ALK fusion proteins and ALK point mutation variants. Inhibition of ALK leads to both the disruption of ALK-mediated signaling and the inhibition of cell growth in ALK-overexpressing tumor cells. ALK belongs to the insulin receptor superfamily and plays an important role in nervous system development. ALK dysregulation and gene rearrangements are associated with a variety of tumor cell types. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 2014 and has 3 approved and 10 investigational indications."

The physiologic effect of this molecule is by means of Centrally-mediated Muscle Relaxation. This molecule is a centrally acting muscle relaxant commonly used for low back pain. This molecule has been linked to rare instances of acute liver injury, a few of which have been fatal. This molecule is a benzoxazolone derivative with mild sedative and centrally-acting muscle relaxant activities. Although its exact mechanism of action is unknown, this molecule appears to act at the spinal cord and subcortical levels of the brain to inhibit multisynaptic reflex arcs involved in producing and maintaining muscle spasms. This agent is extensively hydroxylated by cytochrome P450 2E1 to 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone ,11,12 which is subsequently glucuronidated and eliminated renally. Highly selective for CYP2E1, CZ may be used as a selective probe for phenotyping CYP2E1 in humans; the ratio of HCZ-to-CZ plasma concentrations obtained 2 to 4 hours after oral administration of CZ may be used as a phenotypic measure of CYP2E1 enzymatic activity.

        "description": "This molecule is a member of the class of imidazoles that is 1H-imidazole substituted by a 1-[amino]-2-methylpropan-2-yl group at position 1 and a {N-[-6,8-difluoro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-yl]-L-norvalyl}amino group at position 4. It is a gamma-secretase inhibitor whose hydrobromide salt is indicated for adult patients with progressing desmoid tumours who require systemic treatment. It has a role as an antineoplastic agent and a gamma-secretase modulator. It is a member of tetralins, an organofluorine compound, a secondary carboxamide, a secondary amino compound and a member of imidazoles. It is a conjugate base of a this molecule. This molecule is a small-molecule gamma-secretase inhibitor that was investigated as a potential treatment for desmoid tumors. Desmoid tumors are typically characterized by aberrant activation in Notch signaling. Interaction between the notch receptors and their ligands activates proteolytic cleavage by gamma-secretase; therefore, the inhibition of gamma-secretase can potentially inhibit Notch signaling and thus impede the growth of desmoid tumors. This molecule was approved under the brand name this molecule on November 27, 2023, by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with progressing desmoid tumors who require systemic treatment. It was previously granted breakthrough therapy, fast track, and orphan drug designations for the treatment of desmoid tumors, and the final approval was based on positive results obtained in the Phase 3 DeFi trial, where a confirmed objective response rate was observed to be 41% compared to 8% with the placebo. This molecule is a Gamma Secretase Inhibitor. The mechanism of action of this molecule is as a Gamma Secretase Inhibitor, and Cytochrome P450 3A Inhibitor, and Cytochrome P450 2C19 Inducer. This molecule is a selective gamma secretase inhibitor with antitumor activity. Upon administration, this molecule targets and binds to GS, thereby blocking the proteolytic activation of Notch receptors. This inhibits the Notch signaling pathway and results in the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells that overexpress Notch. The integral membrane protein GS is a multi-subunit protease complex that cleaves single-pass transmembrane proteins, such as Notch receptors, at residues within their transmembrane domains. Overexpression of the Notch signaling pathway has been correlated with increased tumor cell growth and survival. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of III and has 7 investigational indications."

In 2010, it was estimated that 36 million people worldwide live with Alzheimer's Disease. In 2013, this number increased to 44 million. Almost doubling every 20 years, the prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease is predicted to reach 66 million by 2030 and to 115 million by 2050. In December 2013, the G8 dementia summit concluded that dementia should be considered a global priority with the objective of developing a cure or a disease-modifying therapy by the year 2025. This molecule is a N-methyl-D-aspartate Receptor Antagonist. The mechanism of action of this molecule is as a NMDA Receptor Antagonist. This molecule is an oral N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist used in the therapy of Alzheimer disease and dementia. This molecule is associated with a minimal rate of serum enzyme elevations during therapy and has only rarely been implicated as a cause of clinically apparent acute liver injury. This molecule is a low-affinity, voltage-dependent, noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist. This molecule binds to and inhibits cation channels of glutamanergic NMDA receptors located in the central nervous system , preventing the prolonged influx of calcium ions and the associated neuronal excitotoxicity, and thereby potentially enhancing cognitive function. This molecule is also a 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor and nicotinic receptor antagonist. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 2003 and is indicated for alzheimer disease and dementia and has 51 investigational indications. This molecule is an amantadine derivative with low to moderate-affinity for NMDA receptors. It is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist that binds preferentially to NMDA receptor-operated cation channels.

It is a carboxylic ester, a pyrrolotriazine, a nitrile, a phosphoramidate ester, a C-nucleoside and an aromatic amine. It is functionally related to a GS-441524. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 , which is a respiratory disease that is capable of progressing to viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ; COVID-19 can be fatal. Like other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 depends on an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme complex for genomic replication, which can be inhibited by a class of drugs known as nucleoside analogues. This molecule is an adenosine triphosphate analogue first described in the literature in 2016 as a potential treatment for Ebola. Broad antiviral activity of this molecule is suggested by its mechanism of action, and to date, it has demonstrated in vitro activity against the Arenaviridae, Flaviviridae, Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae, and Coronaviridae viral families. This molecule activity against the Coronaviridae family was first demonstrated in 2017, leading to considerable interest in this molecule as a possible treatment for COVID-19. This molecule was confirmed as a non-obligate chain terminator of RdRp from SARS-CoV-2 and the related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and has been investigated in multiple COVID-19 clinical trials.

Novartis' brand name this molecule had originally received approval from the US FDA in 2002 for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation . It was, however, voluntarily withdrawn from widespread use in the US market in 2007 after concerns arose over the possibility that this molecule could potentially cause dangerous cardiovascular events in patients. Since then, closer evaluations of the original data suggesting such cardiovascular risk have resulted in the limited reintroduction or 're-approval' of this molecule for treatment of IBS-C specifically in female patients less than 65 years of age and whom are considered to be at a lower risk of a cardiovascular event than the broader population. This molecule by Sloan Pharma subsequently gained re-approval in April of 2019. Nevertheless, this molecule remains un-approved in certain regions. Despite the relative complications involved in its history of regulatory approval, ever since its first introduction in 2002 this molecule remains the only therapy for IBS-C that possesses the unique mechanism of action of acting on serotonin-4 ) receptors in smooth muscle cells and in the gastrointestinal wall to facilitate actions like esophageal relaxation, peristaltic gut movement, and natural secretions in the gut, among others. This molecule is a Serotonin-4 Receptor Agonist. The mechanism of action of this molecule is as a Serotonin 4 Receptor Agonist. This molecule has been reported in Geodia barretti with data available.

        "description": "This molecule is a member of the class of 1-benzofurans used for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. It has a role as an anti-arrhythmia drug, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is a member of 1-benzofurans, a tertiary amino compound, a sulfonamide, an aromatic ketone and an aromatic ether. This molecule is a Class III antiarrhythmic drug that works to restore the normal sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a common sustained arrhythmia where the treatment primarily focuses on stroke prevention and symptom management. It is managed by rate control, rhythm control, prevention of thromboembolic events, and treatment of the underlying disease. Similar to [amiodarone], this molecule is a multichannel blocker that works to control rhythm and rate in atrial fibrillation. It meets criteria of all four Vaughan Williams antiarrhythmic drug classes by blocking sodium, potassium, and calcium ion channels and inhibiting \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. This molecule is a related benzofuran compound to amiodarone but its chemical structure lacks iodine moieties which are associated with amiodarone-induced thyroid problems. Additionally, the methyl sulfonyl group in its structure renders this molecule to be more lipophilic with a shorter half-life than amiodarone. This ultimately leads to reduced tissue accumulation of the drug and decreased risk for organ toxicities, such as thyroid and pulmonary toxicities. Commonly marketed as this molecule\u00ae, this molecule was approved by the FDA in July 2009 and Health Canada in August 2009. A safety concern for the risk of drug-induced hepatocellular injury has been issued following marketing of this molecule. This molecule is an Antiarrhythmic. This molecule is an antiarrhythmic and a synthetic derivative of amiodarone that is used for maintaining sinus rhythm for patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter. This molecule is associated with a variable rate of serum enzyme elevations during therapy and to rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury, which can be severe and have resulted in deaths and need for liver transplantation. This molecule is an orally bioavailable benzofuran derivative, with anti-arrhythmic activity. Upon oral administration, and although the exact mechanism of action through which this molecule exerts its anti-arrhythmic effect has not been fully elucidated, it inhibits multiple voltage-gated ion channels, including sodium, potassium, and calcium ion channels, and restores the normal sinus rhythm and reduces heart rate in atrial fibrillation. It also non-competitively antagonizes adrenergic receptors. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 2009 and is indicated for atrial fibrillation and has 4 investigational indications.

This molecule is a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker that is widely used for the therapy of hypertension, angina pectoris and prevention of vascular headaches. This molecule has yet to be convincingly associated with clinically apparent liver injury and is often used in patients with liver disease and cirrhosis. This molecule is a propanolamine derivative and a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist with antihypertensive property. This molecule competitively binds to beta-1-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and beta-2-receptors in the bronchial and vascular smooth muscle, resulting in a decrease in beta-adrenergic stimulation. Beta-1-receptor blockade results in a decrease in resting and exercise heart rate and cardiac output, a decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and, possibly, a reduction in reflex orthostatic hypotension. Beta-2-blockade results in an increase in peripheral vascular resistance. The ultimate results include vasodilation, and negative chronotropic and inotropic cardiac effects. In addition, this molecule reduces intra-ocular pressure possibly by decreasing aqueous humor production by reduction of blood flow to the ciliary processes and cAMP synthesis. This molecule is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 1978 and has 4 approved and 13 investigational indications. A beta-adrenergic antagonist that is similar in action to PROPRANOLOL; the levo-isomer is more active.

The mechanism of action of this molecule is as a Stem Cell Factor Receptor Inhibitor, and Platelet-derived Growth Factor alpha Receptor Inhibitor, and Cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor, and P-Glycoprotein Inhibitor, and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein Inhibitor. This molecule is a multikinase inhibitor that is used to treat refractory forms of advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Serum aminotransferase elevations occur in a small proportion of patients treated with this molecule, but episodes of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice have not been reported with its use. This molecule is an orally bioavailable switch pocket control inhibitor of wild-type and mutated forms of the tumor-associated antigens mast/stem cell factor receptor KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha , with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, this molecule targets and binds to both wild-type and mutant forms of KIT and PDGFRa specifically at their switch pocket binding sites, thereby preventing the switch from inactive to active conformations of these kinases and inactivating their wild-type and mutant forms. This abrogates KIT/PDGFRa-mediated tumor cell signaling and prevents proliferation in KIT/PDGFRa-driven cancers. This molecule also inhibits several other kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 , angiopoietin-1 receptor , PDGFR-beta and macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor , thereby further inhibiting tumor cell growth. KIT and PDGFRa are tyrosine kinase receptors that are upregulated or mutated in a variety of cancer cell types; mutated forms play a key role in the regulation of tumor cell proliferation and resistance to chemotherapy.
